## Testing the Application

In order to test the functionality of the application you will need 
to have access to medical images. Sample images from the MedMNIST dataset 
can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist).

Follow [this tutorial](./tutorial/deploy_app.md) to test the application.
